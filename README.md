<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Creating native C++ GUI apps is cumbersome when all the mature options seem to look samesy and stifle creativity. Leveraging the power and flexibility of ImGUI, this issue is averted but getting that running adds unneeded friction. That's what this library attempts to solve.

> NOTE: The project is still fairly young so it's missing some vital features but for most it should suffice. If you need a particular feature implemented just create a feature request in the issues section.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage and Examples

TODO: The library has yet to be implemented, but I do the README first for absolutely no reason.
